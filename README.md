# Blackjack SE
##### by Miguel Garcia

## Description
Blackjack Simple Edition (SE) is my take on the popular casino game, Blackjack.

The initial goal of this project was to create a simple web-based Blackjack game. This involved using a single deck of cards, one player, and only two game actions (Hit and Stay), along with a straightforward UI design.

During development, I decided to incorporate animations to enhance the gameplay experience. Specifically, I implemented card rendering animations so that cards would appear on the screen as if they were being dealt, rather than instantly rendering on the screen. This also included animating the card counter.

After successfully creating a functional prototype of the game, my enthusiasm to expand upon it grew. I'm currently in the process of adding more game features to bring it closer to the actual gameplay of Blackjack and working on implementing customizable settings to enhance the player's experience.

I enjoy taking on fun side projects, as they help me refine my skills. I particularly relished working on this project because it allowed me to learn more about the terminology and rules of the game of Blackjack.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it.
